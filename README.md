# Monte Carlo simulation: Truck unloading schedule

Provides insight into schedule stability and recommendation for ideal/stable time interval for a truck unloading schedule at a warehouse.

This is an implementation of the Monte Carlo simulation approach. The model and simulation logic was built from scratch (i.e. using Numpy and Pandas simply for datastructures and randomisation methods).

See [report](https://github.com/oliverlambson/truck_unloading_monte_carlo/blob/master/REPORT_truck_unloading.pdf) for the write-up.

See the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/oliverlambson/truck_unloading_monte_carlo/blob/master/truck_unloading.ipynb) for the simulation model and visualisation code.
